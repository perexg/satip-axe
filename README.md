The firmware contains various versions of [minisatip](https://github.com/catalinii/minisatip)
which is tuned to get the best performance on this hardware. There are many extensions for
the complex hobby satellite reception (like free input mode - use any tuner with any physical input,
DVB-S2 multistream support etc.).

There is no DLNA server, but there is HTTP and FTP server to server for
example m3u playlists to clients.
